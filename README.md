# Open Source Organization
First, we have to give credit to 757.rb.  This readme and our approach to using github is shamelessly ripped from their github organizing repo.

Anyone can contribute and help organize the group. This is *our* group and helping is easy. Just take the following steps.

* Join the [refactorrva](https://github.com/refactorrva) Github organization. Remember to make your membership public so others know.
* Join the list of [watchers](https://github.com/refactorrva/organization/watchers) to this `organizing` repo. This will make sure you get emails on all threads.
* Talk and have fun!


# How We Use Github For Organizing

Everything here is tracked via Github issues. We also use issue labels to help filter topics. The general idea is to start an issue and talk about it.

### Next Meetups

Try to make the title follow a `YEAR-MONTH` naming convention if it for a specific meetup date. We assume we are meeting on the 2nd Tuesday of most every month, so the day is not necessary.  


# Monthly Responsibilities Template

This is a list of what we typically do for each meetup.

* Find and schedule a speaker.
* 1 Week Prior - Edit meetup to include speaker, abstract, lightning talk, and/or agenda.
* Announce main meeting via twitter and google groups.
  * 1 Week Prior
  * 1 Day Prior
  * Current Day
* Show up an hour early to setup meeting venue.

Note: right now the Google Group is still under CVREG, we will probably transition that over.  Also, we need to establish a Twitter feed for RefactorRVA.
